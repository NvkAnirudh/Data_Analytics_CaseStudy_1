# Data_Analytics_CaseStudy_1

**Case Study: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?**

I have taken this case study from the Google Data Analytics professional certificate on Coursera. In this case study, I work for a fictional company named **Cyclistic** which 
is a bike sharing company. As a part of this case study, I will perform a lot of real-world tasks of a data analyst. 

**Scenario**

I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director
of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,
our team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights,
our team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives
must approve our recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data
visualizations. 

**Characters and teams**

1) **Cyclistic:** A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself
apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with
disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about
8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to
commute to work each day

2) **Lily Moreno:** The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns
and initiatives to promote the bike-share program. These may include email, social media, and other channels.

3) **Cyclistic marketing analytics team:** A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and
reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy.

4) **Cyclistic executive team:** The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the
recommended marketing program

**Repository**
The codebase contains three files:
1) An R file where the actual analysis and visualizations took place in R programming language (along with comments)
2) An RMarkdown file where the whole description of the case study is noted down in points. Each step in the analysis is clearly explained here. It also contains the code chunks
from the above file.
3) An HTML file which renders the content in the above RMarkdown file along with the code chunks.


**Dataset**
I will use Cyclistic’s historical trip data to analyze and identify trends. Please find the [previous 12 months of Cyclistic trip data here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).
The datasets have a different name because Cyclistic is a fictional company. For the purposes of this case study,
the datasets are appropriate and will enable you to answer the business questions. The data has been made available by
Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).
